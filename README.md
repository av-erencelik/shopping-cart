# MemoryBall Game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description 

After finishing memory game project and learning more about react-router, The Odin Project website's curriculums next project was creating a e-commerce site without checkout. I only used function components for this project because React's recent beta docs only focused on function components on hooks. This is the third project that I ever created with ReactJS. I am happy that I was able to finish project successfully. For the first time in this project, I felt the need to share data among unrelated components. As a result of my research, I learned that it is necessary to use the react-redux or useContext API. After this project, I decided to learn both react-redux and useContext.
